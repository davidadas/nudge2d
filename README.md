## DESCRIPTION

A game I decided to throw together one weekend but probably didn't finish so as to have something to do the following weekend.

### Setup

Setting up the Nudge2D is pretty easy.  Simply follow the following:
* Clone this project using your favorite repository (i.e. Git).
* Open the `nudge2d/index.html` file in your favorite browser.
* Drop the `nudge2d/` directory onto the icon of your favorite IDE.
* Grab some coffee, turn on Netflix, and start coding.
